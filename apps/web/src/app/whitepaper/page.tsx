              <span className="text-primary">Problem</span> Statement
            </h1>
            <p className="text-base">
              The current music industry is plagued by inefficiencies,
              inequities, and centralized control. Artists face numerous
              challenges in navigating the complex landscape of the industry,
              often finding themselves at the mercy of traditional record labels
              and intermediaries.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-8 text-base text-gray-400">
              <li>
                Centralized Control: Traditional record labels wield significant
                power and control over artists, often dictating creative
                decisions, ownership rights, and revenue sharing arrangements.
                This centralized control restricts artists' autonomy and limits
                their ability to realize the full value of their creative work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lack of Ownership: Many artists struggle to retain ownership of
                their music and intellectual property rights in the face of
                industry pressures and contractual obligations. As a result,
                artists may find themselves marginalized and exploited, with
                little control over their own artistic creations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Complex Distribution Channels: The proliferation of digital
                platforms and streaming services has fragmented the music
                distribution landscape, making it difficult for artists to
                navigate and monetize their music effectively. Artists must
                contend with opaque royalty structures, complex licensing
                agreements, and a lack of transparency in revenue distribution.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fair Compensation: Despite the increasing volume of music
                consumption, many artists struggle to earn a sustainable income
                from their music. The current revenue model favors streaming
                platforms and intermediaries over artists, resulting in
                inequitable compensation and financial insecurity for creators.
              </li>
              <li>
                Limited Fan Engagement: Traditional distribution channels often
                limit the ability of fans to directly engage with their favorite
                artists and support their work. Artists may find themselves
                disconnected from their audience, relying on impersonal
                marketing tactics and superficial interactions to promote their
                music.

                  to their most dedicated fans, such as meet-and-greets, private
                  concerts, or personalized shout-outs, creating a closer bond

                Investment Opportunities Problem: Traditional investment
                opportunities in the music industry are limited and often
                inaccessible to retail investors.
                <p className="mt-2">
                  Solution: Euterpe democratizes investment in the music
                  industry, allowing fans and investors to invest in the success
                  of their favorite artists through the purchase of artist
                  tokens. By investing in artist tokens, fans can share in the
                  success of artists they believe in, earning returns based on
                  the artist's popularity and revenue generation. In addition to
                  financial returns, investors may also receive exclusive perks
                  and benefits, such as access to exclusive events, merchandise
                  discounts, or voting rights in governance decisions.

                Royalties and Revenue Sharing Problem: Revenue distribution in

                receiving only a fraction of the revenue generated from their
                music.
                <p className="mt-2">
                  Solution: Euterpe facilitates transparent and fair revenue
                  sharing agreements between artists and fans, ensuring that
                  artists receive a fair share of the revenue generated from
                  their music. Through smart contracts and blockchain
                  technology, Euterpe automates royalty payments and revenue
                  sharing arrangements, ensuring that artists are compensated
                  fairly for their creative contributions. Additionally, artists
                  can offer special rewards and incentives to fans who support
                  their music, such as exclusive access to unreleased tracks,
                  early access to concert tickets, or special merchandise
                  offers, creating a mutually beneficial relationship between
                  artists and fans.

            </h1>

              Euterpe (Symbol: ETP) is the native utility token of the Euterpe
              platform. Designed to facilitate transactions, incentivize
              participation, and govern the ecosystem, ETP plays a central role
              in the operation and growth of the platform. Below, we provide an
              overview of the key aspects of Euterpe's tokenomics:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-8 text-base text-gray-400">
              <li>
                Token Supply and Distribution: ETP has a total supply of X
                tokens, initially distributed through various channels including
                sales, liquidity incentives, community rewards, and
                partnerships. This distribution ensures broad accessibility and
                participation across the platform's stakeholders.
              </li>
              <li>
                Token Utility: ETP holds multiple utilities within the
                ecosystem. Primarily, it grants holders governance rights,
                enabling them to participate in decision-making processes
                regarding platform upgrades and ecosystem governance.
                Additionally, EUT is utilized for transaction fees within the
                platform and can be staked by holders to earn rewards and
                contribute to governance mechanisms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ecosystem Growth: Moreover, ETP tokens contribute to the growth
                and development of the ecosystem by funding improvements,
                partnerships, and other initiatives essential for its
                sustainability and expansion.
              </li>
              <li>
                Token Burning and Buybacks: To ensure sustainability and value
                appreciation, Euterpe may periodically burn a portion of the
                token supply and conduct buybacks using platform revenue. These
                measures aim to reduce circulating supply and support token
                value over time.
